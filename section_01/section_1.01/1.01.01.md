# Secion 1.01.01 About Dart

What is Dart?

Dart is a programming language. And programming languages can be, as it turns out, hard to
learn. The fundamentals of Dart are similar to all higher-level languages. You’ll find
familiarity in Dart syntax if you’re coming from JavaScript, Java, or any other C-like
language. You’ll feel comfortable with Dart’s object-oriented design if you’re coming
from Ruby or Python.

There’s good news, though. Dart excels at being a “safe” language to learn. Google
didn’t set out to create anything innovative with Dart. Google wanted to make a language
that was simple and productive and that could be compiled into JavaScript.
What Google came up with works well for writing UIs.

In Dart, there are no modules (like C# and the like), and there is really only one
dynamic in which people write Dart code: object-oriented. Types are used in Dart,
which can be a hurdle if you’re coming from Ruby, Python, or JavaScript, but the type
system is not as strict as in many typed languages.
All this is to say that Dart is a relatively easy language to learn, but you should take
the time you need to learn it. Writing an app in Flutter is writing Dart. Flutter is,
underneath it all, a library of Dart classes. There is no markup language involved or
JSX-style hybrid language. It’ll be much easier to be a productive Flutter developer if
you’re comfortable writing effective Dart code.
