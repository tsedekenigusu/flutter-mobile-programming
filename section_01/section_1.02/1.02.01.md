# Secion 1.01.01 Playground Start

Start with the [Dart Playground](https://dartpad.dev/). Later, we'll talk about editors and editor tools.

You can write Dart code here.

```dart
void main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    print('hello ${i + 1}');
  }
}
```
We will learn about package, import, func later. For now, let's look at the playground.

You can click on the share button to share code snippets, if you have questions and want to share some code, you can use [Gist](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/about-gists). With gists, you can share single files, parts of files, and full applications with other people. If you are signed in to GitHub Enterprise when you create a gist, the gist will be associated with your account and you will see it in your list of gists when you navigate to your gist home page, `http(s)://[hostname]/gist` or `http(s)://gist.[hostname]` if subdomains are enabled. For more information on how to create and manage gists visit https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-gists/.

Some useful places to ask questions are: https://forum.example.org/. A lot of "heavy hitters" in the Dart community hang out here.



Finally, click Run, and that will run your code. It compiles down to an executable, and execute it. Dart compiles down to binary, a straight executable, doesn't run on top of another runtime or virtual machine. It's binary code on the hardware.
